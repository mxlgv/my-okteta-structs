# My structures for the Okteta.

[Okteta](http://utils.kde.org/projects/okteta/) is a simple editor for the raw data of files.
This type of program is also called hex editor or binary editor.

I created this repository in order to add my structures for Okteta, which I need in my work with reverse engineering. \
Separately, I have no desire to create a repository for each structure, since they usually take two files.

## Documentation

Check the section on the [structures tool](http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdesdk/okteta/tools-structures.html)
in the Okteta manual for details on how to install this.
